Q1

main idea:
1.Change the number from base-n to base-10.
2.Change the base-10 number to base-m.
3.Display the result.

run the BaseConverter.m and input the n, a number in base n and the m,
then the result will be displayed. 
Any errors with numbers will be indicated by the corresponding error message.

Q2

Main idea:1.take the matrix A and vector b as inputs and check if they are vaild.
2.augment A with b to form the matrix [A|b].
3.perform Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix and find the solution vector x from the last column of the augmented matrix.

run the GaussElim.m and input the matrix A and vector b then the result x will be displayed.
Any errors with numbers will be indicated by the corresponding error message.

Q3
(a)main idea:
1.Input the number (n) of random points to generate. 
2.A counter is initialized at 0 to keep track of the number of points that fall inside the quarter circle.
3.Monte Carlo Simulation
4.Calculate π and error Calculation
5.Results display show the three values required in order of Approximated value for π,Absolute error and Relative error

run the MontePi.m and input the number (n) of random points to generate,then the result will be displayed in order of Approximated value for π,Absolute error and Relative error.
