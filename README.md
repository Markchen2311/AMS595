Q1

main idea:
1.Change the number from base-n to base-10.
2.Change the base-10 number to base-m.
3.Display the result.

run the BaseConverter.m and input the n, a number in base n and the m,
then the result will be displayed. 
Any errors with numbers will be indicated by the corresponding error message.

Q2

Main idea:1.take the matrix A and vector b as inputs and check if they are vaild.
2.augment A with b to form the matrix [A|b].
3.perform Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix and find the solution vector x from the last column of the augmented matrix.

run the GaussElim.m and input the matrix A and vector b then the result x will be displayed.
Any errors with numbers will be indicated by the corresponding error message.
